# A script to enable custom behavior for stopping Cassandra or DSE.
# This script should exit with a status of 0 if the operation is a
# success, and a non-zero value otherwise.

# To enable this script, rename this file to stop-cassandra and
# make sure that it's executable.
#
# Note: for this script to run properly the user running the agent 
# (cassandra by default) must have proper permissions to start
# and stop the DSE/Cassandra process (sudo is acceptable if your
# environment supports it).
