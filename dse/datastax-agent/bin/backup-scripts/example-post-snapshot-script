# An example custom post-snapshot script.
#
# Post-snapshot scripts will not be called with any command line arguments,
# but will receive the list of files included in the snapshot through stdin,
# one file per line.
#
# The script should exit with a status of 0 if all operations complete
# successfully. Otherwise, it should exit with a non-zero status to indicate
# failure.


# Each line from stdin contains the name of an SSTable file or a schema
# definition file that was in the most recent snapshot; read them in and
# back them up.
while read sstable_name; do
    # do something to backup the file
    echo "$sstable_name" >> /tmp/sstables
